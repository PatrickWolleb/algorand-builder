# Checkpoints

This is a blockchain asset/contract deployment tool.
Since blockchain data is immutable (can't be changed) there is no way to rewrite its contents and attempts will result in an error.
To prevent this we propose a checkpont-based model for versioning the contents of the Algorand blockchain.
